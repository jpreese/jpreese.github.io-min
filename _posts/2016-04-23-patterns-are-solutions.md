I believe there comes a point in every budding software developers career, when they will decide that they should learn design patterns. After all, there is more to developing than copying and pasting code from stack overflow, right? They want to be able to *engineer* their own solutions.

However, the majority all seem to fall into a similar trap.  They read book after book. Design Patterns Explained, Head First Design Patterns, and lets not forget what is considered the holy grail of design patterns, the Gang of Four. 

They may then move onto routinely performing katas, such as the the Greed Kata to fully memorize, and perfect their Strategy Pattern implementation. Blissfully awaiting the time where they can actually utilize all of the knowledge they have gained.

Unfortunately, the developer will end up trying to fit the [insert design pattern here] design pattern into every problem, where it probably does not belong. It's a shiny new tool, and they just want to use it everywhere. This is a textbook case of starting with a solution, and trying to find a problem. Which should sound pretty backwards!

You could think of reading about design patterns as reading the answer key for a test. The answer key is going to give specific questions with specific answers. You will probably do really well on that test, but you will leave more than likely not knowing why those were the answers. After all, you didn't put any work into actually solving the problem. You saw a pattern, you knew the answer, and just implemented it without a second thought. What happens on the next test that doesn't include an answer key, but the context is relatively the same?

**Design patterns are solutions**. To appreciate a solution, you must first suffer from the problem. The issue with diving into patterns head first is that you will never truly understand why the solution exists in the first place. The importance of actually experiencing the pains first hand are almost completely ignored.

The point that I want to make most clear is that **you should not try to find solutions to problems that you don't have.**

Now, I'm obviously not saying that reading about design patterns is completely taboo. There are a lot of things that can be learned from reading.  When learning design patterns however, I believe that the best way is to simply write code and make mistakes.  

Go ahead and copy and paste your switch statement throughout your code base, what does it really matter? You'll soon find out when you want to introduce a new case in your statement.
